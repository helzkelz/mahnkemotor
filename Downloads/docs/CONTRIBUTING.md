# Operator & Collaborator Guide

## Onboarding

- Read [Vision & Philosophy](VISION.md).
- Understand [Monorepo Structure](STRUCTURE.md).
- Meet the [Daemon Toolbox](AGENTS.md).

## Contributing

1. Fork and branch as needed.
2. Follow code style guides and use the existing daemons as reference.
3. Document your changes in `/docs` and update the relevant agent stubs.
4. All new branches and features must be registered with `metaMissionDaemon@1` for automated self-improvement tracking.

## Auditing & Debugging

- Use the Operator Dashboard for real-time mission and ritual feed.
- All agent actions and errors are logged to the `ritual-ledger` and surfaced in `/runtime/logs/`.
