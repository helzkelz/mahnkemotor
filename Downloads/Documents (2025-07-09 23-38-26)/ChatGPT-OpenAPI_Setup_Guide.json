That means your job is to hand GPT a clean, self-descriptive `.well-known` OpenAPI spec that tells it:\n\n- What endpoints it can call  \n- What parameters those endpoints take  \n- What to expect back (JSON schema)  \n- What auth it needs, if any\n\nThen GPT will “act like a browser user” — clicking, searching, submitting — but it’s actually just calling those defined endpoints.\n\n---\n\n### Your next steps:\n\n**1. Give me a summary of your API or service.**  \nJust a line or two: what it’s for, who it serves, and what kind of things it can do (e.g., “A quote generator API for chaos games,” or “A product catalog for HelenHaus licensing”).\n\n**2. List out some key endpoints you want GPT to use.**  \nEven just in rough terms like:\n- `GET /products`\n- `POST /quote`\n- `GET /profile/{userId}`\n\nFrom that, I’ll generate the OpenAPI schema that GPTs can consume.\n\n---\n\nWant me to scaffold you a dummy JSON that works in GPTs to test with?
