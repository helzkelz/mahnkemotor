If they’re a partner:\n   - They get logs **only for their guild**\n4. If it’s **you or a flagged HHQ admin**, you get the full firehose\n\n---\n\n## 🚨 MICRO-ACTIONS NEEDED FROM YOU\n\n### ✅ Confirm these:\n- [ ] You want logs sent to **channels in HHQ**, organized per partner\n- [ ] Partners **don’t get access to HHQ**, they just get slash commands in their own server\n- [ ] You want **optional Google Sheet mirror** per partner for transparency/backup\n\n### 🔑 Then answer:\n- Do you want a **partner-level role** to toggle their trust level? (`@trusted_partner`)\n- How should we **identify YOU** for full access? (bot owner ID? your Discord ID?)\n\nOnce you confirm, I’ll drop the `log_dispatcher.py`, `audit.py`, and `recall.py` with that multi-tenant setup baked in.\n\nYou’re building the **NSA for server chaos**, but with trust and consent.

When you say “pull parts,” do you want partners to:\n   - [ ] Filter inside dashboard UI?\n   - [ ] Also export specific chunks? (`Export red flags`, etc.)\n3. Do you want **color-coded sections** for visual cues in the Sheet itself? (e.g., red flags in red rows?)\n\nOnce you confirm that, I’ll:\n\n- Finalize the Google Sheets schema\n- Hook the bot into it\n- Start scaffolding the dashboard frontend\n\nWe’re turning Google Sheets into a damn **intel hub**—lightweight, modular, and deployable today.
