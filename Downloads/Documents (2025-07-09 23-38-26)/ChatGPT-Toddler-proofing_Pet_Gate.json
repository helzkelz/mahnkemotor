No eye contact. Just vanish the item.\n- Return it hours later like nothing happened.\n- Repeat until they start looking around confused when things start disappearing.\n\n### üêí Channel the Climbing Instinct\nThey want to climb?

Too easy to scale.\n- **Cat door**: Built-in foothole.\n- **Furniture mover toddler**: Will drag anything to breach.\n- **Standard latch**: Might be defeated by observation, repetition, or brute toddler luck.\n\n---\n\n## ‚úÖ YOUR UPGRADE PATH (Tiered Defense Plan)\n\n---\n\n### üîê 1. **Block the Gate's Weak Points**\n- **Plexiglass or hardboard** zip-tied or screwed over the *cat door* on the inside. Make it smooth and flush.\n- If you're stuck with that gate, this is mandatory. That hole is a foothold and crawl-through combo trap.\n\n---\n\n### üß± 2. **Climb-Proof the Entire Gate Area**\n\n#### üìè Option A: Height Buff\n- Replace gate with **40‚Äù+ height**, climb-resistant model.\n  - e.g., Regalo Extra Tall Safety Gate (41‚Äù) ‚Äî ~$45\n  - e.g., Cumbor Auto Close Safety Gate (36‚Äù‚Äì41‚Äù variants)\n\n#### üîß Option B: Barrier Smoothing\n- Wrap the **climber-facing side** with:\n  - Plexi panel\n  - Clear acrylic sheet\n  - Tensioned mesh or heavy vinyl sheet\n- This erases grip and toe-holds.\n\n#### ‚ö†Ô∏è Optional Upgrade: Mount It **Backwards**\n- If the latch is too easy: install the gate *so the release mechanism is on the opposite side* of approach.\n- Use wall anchors to mount it *solid*, no pressure-mount flimsy nonsense if climbing is in play.\n\n---\n\n### üöß 3. **Control the Terrain Around It**\nSince your toddler is dragging tables over like they‚Äôre staging a siege:\n\n#### üî® You must **isolate the gate**\n- Move furniture > 6 feet from gate zone.\n- Use heavy baskets, rubber-based playmats, or intentionally block **paths to move furniture**.\n- Flip stools/tables upside down when not in use.\n\n#### üß≤ If needed, **anchor small furniture**:\n- Velcro to the floor.\n- Use silicone feet grips.\n- Bungee cords for chair stacks.\n\n---\n\n### üì£ 4. **If They Get Creative ‚Äî Escalate Further**\n- **Add a second gate stacked on top** (Redneck Baby Tower Defense, and yes it works).\n- Motion sensor alarm or chime on the gate = early warning.\n- **Remove visibility**: cover the gate so they can‚Äôt see what‚Äôs on the other side.
