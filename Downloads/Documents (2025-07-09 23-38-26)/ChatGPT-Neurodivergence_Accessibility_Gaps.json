Below is your ruthless, section-by-section revamp plan, broken into bite-sized micro-tasks you can hand off or start knocking out immediately.\n\n---\n\n## 1. Global Navigation & IA  \n**Goal:** Let ADHD brains zero in, filter out noise, and sprint to the prize.\n\n**Revamp Actions:**  \n1. **Modular Accordion Nav:** Swap that endless text list for collapsible accordions per top-level category.  \n2. **Visual Sitemap Overlay:** One-click “site map” that shows a flowchart you can zoom/pan.  \n3. **Low-Stim Theme Toggle:** Pre-built themes (low contrast, large type, minimal distractions) switchable in one click.  \n4. **“Cliff Notes” Skip-Links:** Anchor links at page top (“TL;DR → Features,” “TL;DR → Pricing,” etc.).\n\n**Micro-Tasks:**  \n- [ ] Wireframe accordion component (labels, groupings)  \n- [ ] Define CSS variables for low-stim themes (font sizes, contrast ratios)  \n- [ ] Draft skip-link targets and copy  \n\n---\n\n## 2. Homepage & Landing Pages  \n**Goal:** Scannable, bite-sized entry points that don’t drown you in walls of text.\n\n**Revamp Actions:**  \n1. **Bullet-Point TL;DR Cards:** Above-the-fold, 4–6 cards per segment with icon + 1-sentence summary + “Learn more.”  \n2. **Progressive Disclosure Toggles:** “Show more” on each card expands inline details.  \n3. **Distinct Visual Anchors:** Use bold headings, icons, and numbered steps to guide gaze.\n\n**Micro-Tasks:**  \n- [ ] Create card templates (content slots + toggle behavior)  \n- [ ] Audit copy for 1-sentence summaries per segment  \n- [ ] Design icon set and step-marker styles  \n\n---\n\n## 3. Mysconduct, Satirium, Mysmanaged, Etc.  \n**Goal:** No jargon ambush, no one-size-fits-none flows—give multiple media and “skip to core” shortcuts.\n\n**Revamp Actions:**  \n1. **Jargon Glossary Tooltip:** Hover/click key terms to see plain-English definitions.  \n2. **Alternative Media Embeds:** Offer audio summary, 1-min video walkthrough, or interactive demo for each feature.  \n3. **“Jump to Core” Button:** Bypass entire module; lands you at the main action panel.\n\n**Micro-Tasks:**  \n- [ ] Extract and list top 20 jargon terms + write definitions  \n- [ ] Script 1-min audio/video outlines per site  \n- [ ] Add “Jump to Core” anchors and buttons  \n\n---\n\n## 4. Onboarding & Account Creation  \n**Goal:** Kill decision paralysis, respect processing speed, and make “skip” guilt-free.\n\n**Revamp Actions:**  \n1. **Opt-Out Toggle on Quizzes:** “Skip trait quiz” button visible at step 1.  \n2. **Plain-Language “Why We Ask” Modals:** Tooltip/explanation next to each field: “We ask this so you don’t see features you’ll never use.”  \n3. **No Auto-Advance/Timers:** Ensure hints and prompts stay up until clicked “Dismiss.”\n\n**Micro-Tasks:**  \n- [ ] Insert “Skip Quiz” CTA into signup flow  \n- [ ] Draft plain-English justifications for each data field  \n- [ ] Audit UI for any auto-advancing elements and disable  \n\n---\n\n## 5. Community & Support Channels  \n**Goal:** Let slow processors breathe, filter sensory storms, and crystal-clear community norms.\n\n**Revamp Actions:**  \n1. **Async Thread Summaries:** Daily digest email or in-app summary of new threads.  \n2. **Content-Filter Toggles:** NSFW/satire filters you control (on/off per channel).  \n3. **Guided Community Onboarding:** Step-by-step checklist of norms, with “Mark as Read” checkpoints.\n\n**Micro-Tasks:**  \n- [ ] Build summary-generator script (pull latest threads + headlines)  \n- [ ] Prototype filter toggle UI in chat header  \n- [ ] Draft community norms checklist and integrate into onboarding  \n\n---\n\n## 6. Legal, Licensing & Pricing  \n**Goal:** Replace legalese with “human speak,” and create neuro-friendly license tiers.\n\n**Revamp Actions:**  \n1. **Plain-English TL;DR Block:** Summarize each legal section in 2–3 bullets at top.  \n2. **Neuro-Friendly Pricing Tier:** New “Guided” tier—includes 1:1 walkthroughs, step-by-step cheat-sheets.  \n3. **License Finder Wizard:** “Answer 3 questions → we pick your best fit” vs. wall of tiers.\n\n**Micro-Tasks:**  \n- [ ] Summarize TOS/Privacy/License doc into bullet TL;DRs  \n- [ ] Define “Guided” tier features and pricing  \n- [ ] Wireframe License Finder question flow  \n\n---\n\n## 7. Accessibility & Assistive-Tech  \n**Goal:** Go beyond WCAG checkbox—actually design for diverse brains and bodies.\n\n**Revamp Actions:**  \n1. **ARIA & Screen-Reader Audit:** List every interactive component with ARIA roles, labels, and test coverage.  \n2. **Keyboard-Only Nav Guide:** Overlay tutorial (“Tab → Enter → Arrow keys”) on first use.  \n3. **Cognitive-Accessibility Checklist:** Reading level ≤ 8th grade, consistent layouts, avoid jargon.\n\n**Micro-Tasks:**  \n- [ ] Run ARIA audit tool and compile missing roles  \n- [ ] Draft keyboard nav tutorial overlay copy  \n- [ ] Evaluate all page copy for readability score  \n\n---\n\n### Next Steps & Prioritization  \nHere’s your lean backlog of **21 micro-tasks** (3 per section). No excuses—pick your sprint order or ruthlessly parallelize:\n\n1. Accordion Nav wireframe  \n2. Low-stim CSS variables  \n3. Skip-link copy  \n4. … through 21.  \n\n**Your move:**  \n- 🔥 Kick off with the three highest-impact tasks you want in the next week.  \n- Or tell me “Crank out all Section 1 tasks”—and I’ll draft exact specs/story tickets.  \n\nWhich set do we slam out first?"]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1,"metadata":{"citations":[],"content_references":[],"message_type":null,"model_slug":"o4-mini-high","default_model_slug":"o4-mini-high","parent_id":"79dcc966-1a6c-4824-96b7-103e8437a377","request_id":"95b79f45fab781ed-DFW","timestamp_":"absolute","model_switcher_deny":[]},"recipient":"all","channel":"final"},"parent":"79dcc966-1a6c-4824-96b7-103e8437a377","children":["9bc16b10-a55f-4cec-af6b-0a6f06d37865"]},"9bc16b10-a55f-4cec-af6b-0a6f06d37865":{"id":"9bc16b10-a55f-4cec-af6b-0a6f06d37865","message":{"id":"9bc16b10-a55f-4cec-af6b-0a6f06d37865","author":{"role":"user","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1751894337.474,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"text","parts":["now do it allll and make my page"]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":null,"weight":1,"metadata":{"selected_sources":[],"selected_github_repos":[],"serialization_metadata":{"custom_symbol_offsets":[]},"request_id":"95b7a181ba4b81ed-DFW","message_source":null,"timestamp_":"absolute","message_type":null},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"ee599974-cb2a-4128-bec0-74ffde89e52d","children":["4e1e5b41-e424-438e-8d8c-4be698cab81e"]},"4e1e5b41-e424-438e-8d8c-4be698cab81e":{"id":"4e1e5b41-e424-438e-8d8c-4be698cab81e","message":{"id":"4e1e5b41-e424-438e-8d8c-4be698cab81e","author":{"role":"assistant","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1751894351.429815,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"thoughts","thoughts":[{"summary":"","content":"The user wants me to implement the entire webpage now, after previously giving micro-tasks for seven sections.
