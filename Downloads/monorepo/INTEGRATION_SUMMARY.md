- Operator ritual section with activation command
- Fully responsive design

### Interactive Component (`ProductionGoLiveSOPEnhanced`)
- All features from static version
- Clickable checklist items
- Real-time progress tracking
- Progress bar visualization
- Customizable initial state
- Progress callback for external tracking
- Dynamic styling based on completion status
- Celebration UI when all items completed

### Integration Points
- **Dashboard Application**: Primary integration target for operators
- **Navigation**: Easy access from main dashboard
- **Package Structure**: Reusable across multiple applications
- **Testing**: Comprehensive test coverage
- **Documentation**: Storybook stories and README

## Usage Examples

### Basic Integration
```jsx
import { ProductionGoLiveSOP } from '@monorepo/ui';

function OperationsPage() {
  return <ProductionGoLiveSOP />;
}
```

### Interactive Integration
```jsx
import { ProductionGoLiveSOPEnhanced } from '@monorepo/ui';

function InteractiveSOP() {
  const handleProgress = (progress) => {
    console.log(`Deployment progress: ${progress}%`);
  };

  return (
    <ProductionGoLiveSOPEnhanced
      interactive={true}
      onProgress={handleProgress}
      initialState={{
        'domain-daemon': false,
        'alerts-tested': false,
      }}
    />
  );
}
```

## Testing Commands

```bash
# Run all tests
cd packages/ui && npm test

# Run tests in watch mode
cd packages/ui && npm run test:watch

# Generate coverage report
cd packages/ui && npm run test:coverage

# Start Storybook
cd packages/ui && npm run storybook
```

## Next Steps & Recommendations

1. **Additional Applications**: The component can be integrated into other web applications in the monorepo following the same pattern
2. **Persistence**: Consider adding local storage or backend integration for progress state
3. **Notifications**: Add integration with alerting systems for completion notifications
4. **Automation**: Connect checklist items to actual system checks
5. **Deployment**: Set up CI/CD pipeline for the UI package

## Summary
The ProductionGoLiveSOP component has been successfully integrated into the monorepo with comprehensive testing, documentation, and multiple deployment options. The dashboard application now provides both static and interactive versions of the production checklist, enabling operators to track deployment readiness effectively.
