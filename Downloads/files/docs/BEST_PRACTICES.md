# üõ°Ô∏è Godmode OS Best Practices Digest (Cross-Repo/Platform)

This document synthesizes proven best practices from all HelenKella branches and platform repos (including VaultKeeperAI1.1, platform, gamebot, and your monorepo vision).  
**Follow these to ensure: maximum resilience, security, developer joy, and neurodivergent-operator sovereignty.**

---

## 1. üóÉÔ∏è **Project & Monorepo Structure**

- **Mono-rooted, Branch-aware:**  
  Place all apps (`/apps`), daemons (`/packages/agents`), shared utils, and schemas in a single workspace.  
  Explicitly structure for cross-branch extension (HelenKella, Mysconduct, Satirium, Lorefront, etc.).
- **Platform-Ready Folders:**  
  Each platform (or bot) gets its own `/src`, `/public`, and dedicated README, CONTRIBUTING, SECURITY files.
- **Dotenv Hygiene:**  
  Always include `.env.example` and `.dockerignore`/`.gitignore` to prevent secret leakage.

---

## 2. üîí **Secrets & Security**

- **Environment Variables Only:**  
  All secrets (API keys, DB URIs, tokens) must be loaded from environment vars, never hardcoded.
- **Secret Management:**  
  Use platform secret stores (GitHub Secrets, Google Secret Manager, etc.) for CI/CD and cloud deployment.
- **Role-Restricted Endpoints:**  
  Lock down admin dashboards and sensitive APIs with strong auth (never public).
- **Zero Data Extraction by Default:**  
  Log only what‚Äôs essential; give users full control over their data visibility (consent-first, ND-aligned).
- **Vulnerability Reporting:**  
  Provide a clear SECURITY.md with a non-public email for responsible disclosure.

---

## 3. üßë‚Äçüíª **Development & Workflow**

- **Containerization:**  
  All apps and bots must provide a Dockerfile (or docker-compose) and document local + cloud deployment.
- **CI/CD Automation:**  
  Use GitHub Actions for linting, testing, static deploys (see VaultKeeperAI1.1 static.yml) and container builds.
- **Multi-Workflow Support:**  
  Support for dev, prod, test, and ‚Äúreset/clean‚Äù via scripts or workflow definitions (see .replit and workflow tasks).
- **Modular Daemon Design:**  
  Each agent/daemon is atomic, testable, and registered in a central registry.
- **Healthy Defaults:**  
  Expose health-check endpoints or events and implement automated service restarts on failure.

---

## 4. üß† **Bots & Autonomous Agents**

- **Token Hygiene:**  
  Discord and API bots fetch tokens from secrets/env only.
- **Privileged Intents:**  
  Document and enable privileged intents required by bots (e.g., Discord message content).
- **Command Discovery:**  
  Provide help commands or README docs with all available bot/agent commands.
- **Scriptable Tasks:**  
  For event bots, provide modular event packs or challenge templates for rapid extension.

---

## 5. üìù **Documentation & Onboarding**

- **Unified README.md:**  
  Every app, bot, and platform branch gets a README with setup, deployment, and feature documentation.
- **Feature & Security Docs:**  
  Always supply CONTRIBUTING.md and SECURITY.md, with ND/trauma-informed notes and privacy statements.
- **Operator Runbooks:**  
  Provide explicit operator guides for common rituals, resets, and troubleshooting.
- **Quickstart & Workflow Comments:**  
  All workflow files (GitHub Actions, .replit, etc.) are heavily commented for human operators.

---

## 6. ‚ö° **Deployment, Monitoring, & Recovery**

- **Cloud-Native Deploys:**  
  Use Docker, Cloud Run, Netlify, Vercel, or Pages for production builds.
- **Port Mapping & Health:**  
  Clearly map local to external ports (see .replit, Dockerfiles) and document them.
- **Automated Backups:**  
  Schedule database and log backups (document in runbooks).
- **Error & Alert Hooks:**  
  Integrate Discord/webhook/email notifications for critical events and deploys.
- **Zero Downtime:**  
  Prefer rolling or blue/green deploys and utilize cache/CDN purges post-deploy.

---

## 7. ü¶æ **Care Logic, Consent, & ND Alignment**

- **Consent Daemons:**  
  Implement agents or UX flows that track, enforce, and log user consent at all stages (especially in Mysconduct).
- **VIBEWRANGLER/UX Safety:**  
  Use agents to dynamically adapt features, pace, and tone based on operator/user state.
- **Feature Unlocks:**  
  Gated access is determined by readiness, payment, or profile state‚Äînot just raw authentication.
- **Opt-in Logging:**  
  Users always retain the right to audit, redact, or export their usage data.

---

## 8. üõ°Ô∏è **IP, Licensing, & Operator Sovereignty**

- **LICENSE.md & LegalKit:**  
  All branches must include licensing, ToS, and IP statements generated by legalKitDaemon.
- **Operator is Sovereign:**  
  All workflows, automation, and agent logic are designed to keep the operator in control‚Äînever the platform.

---

## 9. üîÑ **Cross-Platform & Inter-Repo Integration**

- **Unified Agent Glossary:**  
  Maintain a living agent/daemon glossary (cross-repo) so every platform and operator stays in sync.
- **Export Protocols:**  
  Provide ready-to-zip structures, homepage scaffolds, and recommended stacks for easy onboarding or repo migration (see HELEN HAMMER: GOD MODE).

---

## 10. üîó **Best Practice References (from your repos)**

- **gamebot:**  
  - Command-line help, .env secret loading, Docker/Cloud Run deploy recipes, event pack modularity.
- **VaultKeeperAI1.1:**  
  - Multi-mode workflows, explicit port mapping, static site deploys, and .replit for cloud/hybrid ops.
- **platform (HELEN HAMMER):**  
  - Export protocols, homepage templates, feature-rich docs, stack recommendations, care logic in CONTRIBUTING/SECURITY.

---

**Enforce and extend these patterns in every branch, daemon, and deployment.  
Operator is always sovereign.  
Care logic is never optional.  
HelenHaus, out.**
