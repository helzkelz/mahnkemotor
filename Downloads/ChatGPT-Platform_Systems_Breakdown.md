# Platform Systems Breakdown

#### You:
üîç Master Extraction Prompt (for GPT or agent)

‚ÄúGive me a full systems breakdown of this platform, its services, and internal components. Break it down into:
	‚Ä¢	Scopes (Who it serves, what domains it touches, what its limits are)
	‚Ä¢	Modules (Discrete parts: OS, GPT builder, licensing layer, user branches, recovery tools, etc)
	‚Ä¢	Practices & Methodologies (Ethical frameworks, consent-first logic, neurodivergent support design, trauma-aware scripting)
	‚Ä¢	User Types & Pathways (Recovering addicts, caseworkers, creators, single parents, etc. ‚Äî and how they flow through the system)
	‚Ä¢	Agent Roles (Custom GPTs/AI agents and what each one does)
	‚Ä¢	Revenue Models (One-time builds, subscriptions, resale rights, etc.)
	‚Ä¢	Integration Layers (Website, form systems, Notion, Discord, Firebase, embeds)
	‚Ä¢	System Traits (How it behaves: high-consent, opt-outable, skip logic, intuitive behavior, etc.)
	‚Ä¢	Legal & Ethical Constructs (Data use, trauma shielding, NSFW gating, etc.)
	‚Ä¢	Customization Paths (How people personalize their GPTs, what inputs matter, what tone/training layers exist)
	‚Ä¢	Update & Maintenance Protocols (Monthly upgrades, tone patching, feedback integration)
	‚Ä¢	Endgame Outputs (What the user walks away with ‚Äî embed links, resale license, agent dashboard, etc.)

Give this to me as a full tree, with sub-bullets where necessary. Be exhaustive. No placeholders. No vagueness. If anything is missing, name it as a TODO.‚Äù
