# OpenAPI Setup Guide

Setting up my OpenAPI.

Alright, Helen. Let’s slice this fast and tight. Are you talking about:

1. **Authoring your own OpenAPI schema** — to define your endpoints for clients, AI agents, etc.
2. **Registering an API with OpenAI** — to hook up a plugin, GPT action, or agent tool.
3. **Using OpenAPI to document internal services** — as part of your dev stack for other devs or platforms like Swagger or Postman.

Or all of the above because you’re running the whole damn circus?

What’s the **end-use case** you’re aiming for — GPT plugin, client consumption, automated SDK generation, doc rendering, internal service governance?

Next micro-drop: give me your service summary (just a one-liner or two about what your API does), and list out the key endpoints or actions it supports.

Let’s wire this up clean.

So, for my test in GPTs, I want to essentially be able to use them with the browser basically.

Perfect. You’re aiming to use **GPTs with your own API** — probably via **actions** — so GPT can hit your backend just like a browser would, fetch dynamic data, trigger responses, all that jazz.

### Here’s how this works (GPT-side):

GPT doesn’t literally “use a browser” — it simulates browser-like behavior by calling APIs that **you expose via OpenAPI**. That means your job is to hand GPT a clean, self-descriptive `.well-known` OpenAPI spec that tells it:

- What endpoints it can call
- What parameters those endpoints take
- What to expect back (JSON schema)
- What auth it needs, if any

Then GPT will “act like a browser user” — clicking, searching, submitting — but it’s actually just calling those defined endpoints.

### Your next steps:

**1. Give me a summary of your API or service.**\
Just a line or two: what it’s for, who it serves, and what kind of things it can do (e.g., “A quote generator API for chaos games,” or “A product catalog for HelenHaus licensing”).

**2. List out some key endpoints you want GPT to use.**\
Even just in rough terms like:

- `GET /products`
- `POST /quote`
- `GET /profile/{userId}`

From that, I’ll generate the OpenAPI schema that GPTs can consume.

Want me to scaffold you a dummy JSON that works in GPTs to test with? Or are we using an existing service you’ve already hosted? Drop the link or mock structure if so. Let’s get this cookin’.
