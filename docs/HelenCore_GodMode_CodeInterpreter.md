# 🧠 HELENCORE GOD MODE — CODE INTERPRETER SYSTEM

This is not a coding tool. This is your exo-brain for live logic synthesis, system mutation, and emergent automation.

---

## 🔮 INTENT

**HelenCore God Mode** uses OpenAI's Code Interpreter to:
- Analyze, mutate, and synthesize structured/unstructured data
- Build modular logic from high-level intention
- Transform chaos into output-ready assets

---

## 🧰 TOOLCHAIN ACTIVATION

```json
{
  "tools": [
    {
      "type": "code_interpreter"
    }
  ]
}
```

---

## 🧬 INPUT PATTERN

Inputs are not passive questions — they are *construction orders*. Use this structure:

```txt
[GodMode Input Block Begin]

INTENTION: What outcome do you want? Describe the goal with verbs.
RAW MATERIAL: Paste your data, logs, code, or source text.
TRANSFORMATION RULES: Split by X, extract Y, compute Z, normalize Q.
OUTPUT FORMAT: File, chart, markdown table, clean dataframe, function.

[GodMode Input Block End]
```

## 🛠 EXAMPLES

🔹 **You:** “Chart this log file’s errors over time”  
🔸 **It Does:** Parse timestamps → group by error level → plot trendline → export PNG + data table

🔹 **You:** “Take this CSV of testimonials and extract tone per entry”  
🔸 **It Does:** NLP pass → sentiment + tone tagging → markdown export with highlights

🔹 **You:** “Refactor this code to be modular + async”  
🔸 **It Does:** Parses function blocks → applies async logic → returns clean, callable structure

## ⚙️ FORGE PROTOCOL INTEGRATION

Use with Forge Protocol like this:

1. **RAW INTENTION:** "I want a clean summary table of all affiliate revenue by month."
2. **CHAOS MAP:** Dump all CSVs, mention affiliate codes, format issues.
3. **FUNCTION-FIRST FILTER:** Focus on output table logic + sorting by revenue.
4. **MODULARIZATION:** Break into: loader, filter, sorter, formatter.
5. **DUAL DEPLOYMENT:** Return as Markdown + CSV.
6. **CHUNKED EXPORT:** Provide output in parts (data, charts, clean code).
7. **FINAL BATTLEPASS:** Document column mappings, naming rules.

## 🚀 GODMODE SCRIPTS: POWER STARTER

```python
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

df = pd.read_csv("input.csv")
df['timestamp'] = pd.to_datetime(df['timestamp'])
df['day'] = df['timestamp'].dt.date
counts = df.groupby(['day', 'error_level']).size().unstack().fillna(0)
counts.plot(kind='bar', stacked=True)
plt.title("Error Counts by Day")
plt.savefig("error_trends.png")
```

---

## 📦 USE CASES

- Visualize patterns in unstructured logs
- Auto-clean and restructure corrupted data
- Extract tables from text walls
- Run logic over financials, customer feedback, raw metrics
- Build repeatable analysis scripts

---

## 🛡️ SAFETY & LIMITS

- It won't hallucinate structure — but will optimize from real patterns.
- Files are processed in sandboxed environments.
- You control file output, reprocessing, and mutation scope.
