# ü§ñ OPENAI ASSISTANTS API ‚Äî HELENCORE SYSTEM DOC

**Purpose**: Extend the HelenCore platform with AI assistants that are persistent, tool-empowered, and integration-ready. This is not a chatbot layer. This is infrastructure.

---

## üîç CONTEXT

The Assistants API (currently in **Beta**) allows developers to:
- Construct AI assistants with custom behavior
- Give them tools (like File Search, Code Interpreter)
- Store conversations persistently (via Threads)
- Automate meaningful work across text, code, and file inputs

‚ö†Ô∏è **Sunset Warning**: The Assistants API will be deprecated post-2025. Target shutdown: **1H 2026**, replaced by the **Responses API** once feature parity is reached.

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è KEY COMPONENTS

| Object       | Role |
|--------------|------|
| **Assistant** | The programmable AI brain (configured with instructions + tools) |
| **Thread**    | The persistent session. Stores Messages. Enables memory. |
| **Message**   | Interactions from user or assistant ‚Äî can include files |
| **Run**       | Triggered action. Assistant processes all current thread messages |
| **Run Step**  | Sub-actions taken by the Assistant during a Run ‚Äî introspectible |

## üß† HOW TO THINK ABOUT THIS IN HELENCORE

- **Assistant = Modular Cognitive Unit**  
  e.g. Brand Strategist, UX Critic, Deal Vetter, Document Surgeon

- **Thread = Processing Loop**  
  Persistent convo or processing pipeline with history.

- **Run = Execution Pulse**  
  When an Assistant ‚Äúthinks,‚Äù acts, and adds messages.

- **Run Step = Action Log**  
  Breakdown of every move the Assistant made during execution.

## üî® CURRENT TOOLING OPTIONS (BUILT-IN)

1. **Code Interpreter**  
   Crunches numbers, creates charts, parses CSVs, builds files. Think data analyst with an infernal calculator.

2. **File Search**  
   Scans uploaded content for structured recall. Used to reference, summarize, and extract from documents. HelenCore uses this for toolkit synthesis + protocol tracking.

3. **Function Calling**  
   API calls to your own backend or third-party integrations. Wrap your services with smart logic and let assistants invoke them.

## üöÄ HOW TO USE IN PLATFORM

- **Prototypes**: Add Assistants for each user-facing surface. E.g. onboarding, personalization, compliance review.
- **Back Office**: AI Agents can file-sort, tag, prioritize, and synthesize internal documents using File Search + Threads.
- **Productization**: Bundle Assistants as features inside tools built on HelenCore ‚Äî each with tuned instructions and toolchains.

## üß™ GETTING STARTED

- Use the [Assistants Playground](https://platform.openai.com/playground?mode=assistant)
- Follow the [Quickstart Guide](https://platform.openai.com/docs/assistants/quickstart)
- Full object model reference: [Docs](https://platform.openai.com/docs/assistants/overview)

---

## üì¶ DEPLOYMENT PATTERNS (RECOMMENDED)

- **Instruction Sets**: Modularize Assistant personality & task style
- **Thread IDs**: Store as user session anchors
- **File Pipeline**: Route incoming docs to File Search automatically
- **Run Triggers**: Use event-based architecture (message added ‚Üí run launched)

---

## üßØ FUTURE-PROOFING

- Begin mirroring setups using **Responses API** now.
- Treat Assistants API as current-gen experimental layer ‚Äî not for long-term infra locking.
- Build abstraction layers where possible for portability.
